## Task - Data Manipulation
Using the JSON data provided, write functions to output the following:
 The most expensive item
 The cheapest item
 An average price of all items
 The average price of Bridgestone Products
 All prices for tyres with a speed rating of V
Out put the name of the product and the price value if possible.

## Intuition

json is not type safe. Will need to create a type definition for the project
once types are defined, should be pretty easy to sort by price, to find the most expensive and cheapest items

average of all prices will need to maths all the values, then divide by the total count
speed rating of "V" is just a filter on the data set

output the name and price value for each function

## Plan

create a collection of functions.

expensive: sort by price, pop object, return values
cheapest: sort by price, take from front, return value
average: math on obj.value probably use a reduce or foreach. return value
rating: filter on "speed" for "V", return value

## Improvements

You could improve the `byManufacturer` and `bySpeed` by instead of declaring the value, using a index value to allow you to filter by any metric. I've created a demo of this as byMetricSorted and byMetricAverage.

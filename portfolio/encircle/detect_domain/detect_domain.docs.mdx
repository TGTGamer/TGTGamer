## Task - Detect the Domain Name
Using the HTML provided, write a function to identify the unique domain names from the links and
URLS which are embedded in the HTML markup. Output the URLs in alphabetical order.

## Intuition

Use the html file
needs to be a function
Identify unique domains
All http links, other protocols not required
Links are in markdown format, starting with ( and ending with )

Not sure which part of the url they want alphabetically sorting - sorting by basic sort() has done alphabetically on the whole string.

## Plan

Import file system (node:fs)
Import file from file system using relative path

Use file as string
Apply regex to find url's
Use ( and ) to find the start and end of the string


## Problems

Problem 1 - not breaking link end )
```typescript
[
    '(http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/train?view=uk). <i>(definition â€“ Compact OED)',

]
```

Not sure why the regex didn't break here. It should have broken at the "htm)" and "?view=uk" but didn't?
I think it's because there isn't a whiteline break between the links so my regex is going to need changing slightly.

Fixed by switching from "/\(https?:\/\/.*\)/" to "/\(https?:\/\/[^\)]*\)/"

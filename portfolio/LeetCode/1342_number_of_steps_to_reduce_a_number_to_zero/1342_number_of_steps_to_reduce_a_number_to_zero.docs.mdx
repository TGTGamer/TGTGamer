# 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

This project is my attempt at leetcode challange:
1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

You can attempt this challenge yourself [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/)

## Intuition

If your number is even, and you devide by 2,
you get the same result as if your number is odd.

This means you can simply devide by two,
and if the remainder is not 0 add 2 steps to the count,
if it's remainder is 0, add one step.

## Approach

<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

With this problem, most of my approaches relied on the same concept.
I want to reduce the number of times I do math's within the problem.

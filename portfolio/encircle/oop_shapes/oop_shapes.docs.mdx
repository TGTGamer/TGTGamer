## Task - OOP Shapes
Create model classes that will properly represent the following constructs:
 Define a Shape object, where the object is any two-dimensional figure, and has the following
characteristics: a name, a perimeter, and a surface area.
 Define a Circle, retaining and accurately outputting the values of the characteristics of a
Shape.
 Define a Triangle. This time, the name of the triangle should consider if it is equilateral (all 3
sides are the same length), isosceles (only 2 sides are the same length), or scalene (no 2
sides are the same).
 Implement a shape of your choice.

## intuition

I'm not sure I understand the task here.

I think it's asking for a type safe object?

So 2 dimensional figure would be height and width,
Needs to have a name, parimeter and surface area.

Parimeter is easy to calculate on a square,
Surface area is easy to calculate on a 2d object.

Cirlces apparently slightly harder as I can't remember how to calculate the perimitor correctly. I know area is piR^2.

Triangle is interesting, could do this with a bit of advanced typing to understand the object.
